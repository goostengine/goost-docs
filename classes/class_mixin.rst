Mixin
=====

**Inherits:** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

**Experimental!** Adds functionality to :ref:`MixinScript<class_MixinScript>` objects.

Description
-----------

A class which extends the run-time functionality of objects that use :ref:`MixinScript<class_MixinScript>`. All scripts added to :ref:`MixinScript<class_MixinScript>` must inherit from ``Mixin``.

Mixin objects are instantiated internally and cannot be used as a :ref:`Node<class_Node>` in the scene tree.

Properties
----------
