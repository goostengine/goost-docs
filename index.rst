Goost Docs - |goost_branch| branch
==================================

Welcome to the official documentation of
`Goost <https://github.com/goostengine/goost>`_, the free and open source
community-driven `Godot Engine <https://godotengine.org/>`_ extension!

Proceed to the table of contents below and in the sidebar to access the
documentation for your topic of interest.

The :ref:`sec-components` section lists all of the functional components this
extension provides. For a complete list of classes, see :ref:`goost_api`.

.. note::

   Goost is still in development feature-wise (especially the 3D counterpart).
   We are looking for contributors who'd like to help the project by
   implementing new and improving existing features. Read the
   :ref:`sec-development` section for more information.

.. note::

  Goost is developed by people! If you don't understand something or would like to
  improve the existing documentation, feel free to submit an issue or pull request
  on the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/goostengine/goost-docs/issues>`_.
