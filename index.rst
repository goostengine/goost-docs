community-driven `Godot Engine <https://godotengine.org/>`_ extension!

Proceed to the table of contents below and in the sidebar to access the
documentation for your topic of interest.

The :ref:`sec-components` section lists all of the functional components this
extension provides. For a complete list of classes, see :ref:`goost_api`.

.. note::
  Goost is developed by people! If you don't understand something or would like to
  improve the existing documentation, feel free to submit an issue or pull request
